### Project title

Violet

### What and why?

Verified college anonymous (or not) social media network. Users can only post text, and maybe image functionality. Similar to Blind/Twitter. Additionally, this can be whitelabled for other schools. 

This exists so students can have a centralzied place to meet other students, as opposed to a mix of various social media platforms. 

### For whom?

This will be for college students, primarily in decentralized colleges in large cities, much like NYU. 

### How?

There will be a front end where users can make an account, make posts, and see posts once signed in. Accounts may only be created with a verified NYU email. Posts will be sorted by category and/or a timeline in which the user is able to follow certain users or topics. The user will also be able to have direct messages between other users. All posts, users, and messages will be stored on a database. Posts will have various statistics, such as likes or replies. Users will be able to post or reply anonymously or with their username. 

Additionally, there will be content moderation, so moderators and administrators will have the ability to delete posts. 

### Scope

This project is quite flexable, as the minimum viable product and the maximum potential are quite different. Features of the site are easily able to be broken down into stories, and additional functionality can be expanded.
